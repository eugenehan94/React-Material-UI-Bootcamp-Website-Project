              Material UI practices a flipped, immersive model of education that
              puts the emphasis on the development of practical skills through
              building real-world applications using an incremental and
              cumulative collection of tools and best practices. Lectures take
              up a maximum of two and a half hours in any given day, with
              another eight to ten hours being spent each day working in a lab
              setting. You can expect to introduce yourself to new concepts
              through readings and exercises, getting your knowledge bolstered
              and backfilled with lectures throughout the week.

              No formal education is required to being admitted to Material UI
              While having some coding knowledge always helps, your background
              does not matter as much as a genuine interest in code or data
              science and a raw determination to succeed in this challenging
              environment. If youâ€™re interested in our bootcamp but brand new to
              code or data, our intro courses are a perfect way to figure out if
              you're ready for a career as a developer or data analyst.
